# portfolio

This is a portfolio project. The goal of this project is to display my current skillset. 
The website itself is a project, but there are also projects linked within the webpage, all using different programming languages. 
This website project includes a home page, an about page, and a contact page. The home page included an interactive six box grid. Each box links a new project. 
The contact page includes a submission form. I created this website by using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
